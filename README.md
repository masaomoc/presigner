Presigner is a CLI tool to generate Pre-Signed URL for Amazon S3.

## Installation

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install presigner

## Usage

```bash
$ presigner generate --bucket foobucket --key bar.txt --duration 3600 --profile default
```

- Currently, You can provide duration only in seconds.
- ``--profile`` option is the value for ~/.aws/credentials. You should write your credentials in the file. ref: http://blogs.aws.amazon.com/security/post/Tx3D6U6WSFGOK2H/A-New-and-Standardized-Way-to-Manage-Credentials-in-the-AWS-SDKs
